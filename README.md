# Montereyfixes

Alpha working BaseSystem fix installer based mainly on:

ASentientBot patched 0xfff boot.efi and HaxLib.dylib

workaround to boot non metal desktop "enable auto login"

on the ASentientBot method I made a patched Setup Assistant to simplify this step

anyway is expectable that apple will fix this, because safe mode needs to works also without Metal acceleration for supported Mac.
